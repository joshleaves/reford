  <h4>Attention!</h4>

  This chapter cover is a placeholder while the book is still in draft state.

  It was drawn by [Caitlin Rose Boyle](https://caitlinroseboyle.com/) for a [PokéZine about Glitch Pokémon](https://cargocollective.com/rosenbergjordan/PokeZines) and I felt like it aligned with this chapter's contents.

  If you're an artist who got something in mind I could commission from you, feel free to <a href="mailto:josh.guthrie@gmail.com">contact me</a>.
