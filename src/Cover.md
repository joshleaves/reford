<h1 style="text-align: center;">Reverse Engineering for Dabblers</h1>
<h4 style="text-align: center;">A book by <a href="mailto:josh.guthrie@gmail.com">Arnaud "red" Rouyer</a></h3>

<div class="warning">
  <h4>Attention!</h4>

  This cover is a placeholder.

  It was generated using the book's title as a prompt on a [Midjourney-like online app](https://miramuseai.net/app?prompt=reverse%20engineering%20for%20dabblers) since I had no idea on what I would want as a cover, and the idea of "cyber-punk mole ready to dive into the data" is actually inspiring and very *a propos*.

  I am already in discussions with an artist to commission a proper cover picture.
